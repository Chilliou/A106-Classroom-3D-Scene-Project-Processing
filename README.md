# A106 Classroom 3D Scene Project Processing

## Project Overview

This is a 3D scene project recreating the A106 classroom using advanced computer graphics techniques. The goal is to demonstrate comprehensive understanding of 3D modeling, camera manipulation, lighting, and texture application.

## Project Requirements

### Scene Composition
- Create a 3D representation of the A106 classroom
- Use basic geometric shapes (primarily cube deformations)
- Apply textures to various objects in the scene

### Technical Specifications
- Implement a movable camera within the scene
- Add multiple light sources to enhance scene realism
- Utilize modular programming techniques
- Avoid hardcoded values by creating reusable functions

## Notes
- Project is to be completed individually
- Focus on demonstrating learned 3D graphics concepts

## Launch the project
- Install processing on your desktop
